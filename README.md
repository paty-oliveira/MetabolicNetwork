# Construction of application for analysis and visualization of metabolic networks 

The application MetNet allows the implementation of biological networks. The application was developed in Python based on the Object-Oriented paradigm. During the development was applied:

  - Concepts of graphs and topological analysis;
  - Creation of the new algorithms to extract biological meaning;
  - Graphic visualization of the biological networks;
  - Extaction of the biological reactions and equations from the specific metabolic pathway, using KEGG API.
